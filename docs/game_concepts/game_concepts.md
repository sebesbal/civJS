## Similarities to Other Games

### Similarity to Railroad Tycoon 3

In Railroad Tycoon 3, the economy is built around products, producers, and consumers. Each product has a dynamically calculated price for every cell on the map, based on local supply and demand.

For example, if a house consumes alcohol and its demand is not fully satisfied, the price of alcohol increases at that location. The price also increases in neighboring cells, but slightly less, because transportation costs must be subtracted from the final price.

The same logic applies on the production side. If there is an alcohol producer, such as a brewery, the price of alcohol is lowest at the producer’s cell and increases with distance as transportation costs are added.

As the game progresses, prices propagate across the map in a way similar to a cellular automaton. Over time, supply and demand meet, and once a profitable route emerges, alcohol begins to flow from the producer to the consumer.

### Similarity to Sid Meier’s Civilization

In Sid Meier’s Civilization, the player can:

- Found cities  
- Build infrastructure  
- Build military units  
- Wage wars  
- Conduct research  
- And more  

The goal is to create a similar type of game, but with an economic model closer to that of Railroad Tycoon 3.

# Map

The map is a 2D grid made up of cells. Each cell has terrain features that can either help transportation, such as rivers, or hinder it, such as mountains or marshes.
